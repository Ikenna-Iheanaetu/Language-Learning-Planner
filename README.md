# Language Learning Planner

A Flask-based expert system that creates personalized language learning plans based on scientific principles of time allocation and spaced repetition.

## 📋 Project Overview

The Language Learning Planner is an intelligent system that helps language learners optimize their study time. By analyzing available time, learning goals, and language difficulty, it creates structured learning plans with appropriate activities.

### Key Features
**Coming Soon**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Fork and Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-learning-planner.git
cd language-learning-planner
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended)

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application**

```bash
flask run
```

5. **Access the application**

Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 🧠 How the Expert System Works

1. **Enter your language learning details**
   - Target language
   - Current proficiency level
   - Available study time (per day/week)
   - Learning goals (conversation, reading, etc.)

2. **Review your personalized plan**
   - Weekly schedule with specific activities
   - Time allocation across different skills
   - Spaced repetition schedule for reviews

3. **Track your progress**
   - Mark activities as completed
   - See your improvement over time
   - Get adjustments based on performance

## 📁 Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure:

- `app.py` - Main Flask application
- `templates/` - HTML templates for the web interface
- `static/` - CSS, JavaScript, and images
- `docs/` - For all documentation
