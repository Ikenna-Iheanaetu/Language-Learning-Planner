# Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, etc.)
- Keep templates modular with includes and inheritance
- Use Flask's `url_for()` for all links and asset paths
- Include proper form validation attributes
- Use consistent class naming
- Comment sections for clarity
